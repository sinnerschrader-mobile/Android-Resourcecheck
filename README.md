Android-Resourcecheck
===================

A python script that looks into all drawable-*dpi folders in a given android project and checks for possible missing resources. It generates a report file with a list of all missing resources in the projects base folder.

#Possible extensions:
This script can be expanded to get used with buildscripts, check for missing translations in multi-language projects and other automated functions like sending the report as an email etc.
